# GenZ-Monetization-Strategy
A strategic framework for monetizing Gen Z users in AI photo editing apps, utilizing K-Means Clustering and PSM pricing models.

### Project Overview
This case study explores how photo editing apps can balance **Viral Growth (DAU)** with **Sustainable Revenue (LTV)** among Gen Z users. By analyzing the psychological trade-off between "Utility" (Efficiency) and "Vanity" (Social Signaling), I proposed a hybrid monetization ecosystem.

### Methodologies Used
* **User Segmentation:** K-Means Clustering to identify "Aesthetic Chasers" vs. "Pragmatists".
* **Pricing Strategy:** Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM) to determine optimal price points ($2.99 vs. $6.99).
* **WTP Analysis:** Willingness-To-Pay Heatmaps generated via Python.
